# What do you know about stacks?
* It's like a list
  * like a todo list
  * can put things in
  * can take things out (and deal with them)
  * it can be empty - when it's empty, you're done.
* It's like an array
  * "push" is like <<
  * other operations to take data out - "pop"
  * "peek" looks to see what the next thing you WOULD pop is if you popped.
* English-y 'stack'
  * things are piled up on top of each other
  * things that are added go on 'top'
  * also, you take things off from the top
  * "FILO" - First In Last Out
    * there is an order.
* There's another data structure that uses FIFO - First In, First Out
  * "queue"


# this is an example of a 'data structure'
* these are tools
* an array is a simple example
* a ds holds data
* don't code your own except for practice & in interviews. <-- general rule
